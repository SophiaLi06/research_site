I get started with Jekyll today. It's not that easy to learn, but thank you awesome youtuber for the tutorials! 
I have maken some basic changes to the site. I added two pages, one is the home page I literally stole from the HRC2 website. Another one is the design journey page, which is actually the design journey page of my own project 2 for CS 2300.
